    <article>   
        <p>Last year I graduated from the University of Arizona with a B.A. in Philosophy, Political Science, Economics, and Law 
        with the prospect of changing the entire world. I still have that drive to be an influential member of society but I realized 
        the utilization of my abilities and potential require me to change a little too. Before I moved to the bay area I was nearly 
        "computer illiterate" and although programming intrigued me I never considered I would be able to do what they did. In primary
        school I had struggled to learn how to type and use a graphing calculator (however I had a penchant for creative powerpoints). 
        I developed an aversion to tasks that relied on the use of a computer for anything besides writing and research opting for a 
        more traditionally academic major in college. All that changed when I was introduced to the "silicon valley" culture and realized 
        how new the world of programming is and how instrumental it is for sparking positive change. I quickly met wonderful and
         brilliant people involved in everything from web marketing to alternative transportation. I was almost instantly infatuated
        with the energy and innovation of the area, yet still unsure how I could take advantage of the opportunity. I was haunted by my
        childhood struggles with computers and discouraged that I hadn't gotten past that and learned programming when I was younger.
        However, someone opened my eyes and showed me that almost everyone here struggled with some new technology, only becoming the
        experts they are today by facing that struggle head on. I believe I am ready to overcome my weaknesses and face new challenges
        so that I can become part of this culture which I am confident can change the world for the good.

        My academic background enabled me to see human phenomena with an enlightened perspective but I still require the right tools 
        needed to take a statistical approach to understanding the realities. I became interested in the engineering behind big data
        systems, which are important for the creation of political and economic models. After taking a weekend course on data science
        I began to consider more ways to develop my computer skills and which skills were most important. I searched for online classes
        which would teach me Python, R, Ruby, Javascript and other programs and languages. I found some resources helpful yet not as in
         depth and engaging as I would have liked; in short, I didn't feel like I was learning enough or learning it in the right way.
        A friend suggested that a coding bootcamp may be the answer, because it is the best way for me to get involved in the tech world
        right away. I liked the idea because I would be learning in-depth concepts in the way I prefer, with a group of my peers, who are 
        trying to overcome the same obstacles as me.
