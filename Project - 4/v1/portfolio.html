         <h3>'How a "Free" Market Undermines Full Democracy'</h3>
         <a href="../writing/Christiano.pdf"><h4>click here to view full</h4></a>
         
        <p>The Purpose of this paper is to examine and critically assess Lindblom’s argument that the market partially undermines the prospects for full democracy. This will be accomplished by dissecting and analyzing the elements of his argument. First, I will explain Lindblom’s general claim that the market is responsible for partially undermining the prospects for ‘full’ democracy. Second, I will examine the mechanisms by which the market “punishes” policymakers and how this creates a “prison” for social change. Third, I will clarify the reasons why this automatic punishment mechanism described by Lindblom creates a “prison.” Fourth, I will explain what an inducement system is and how it is relevant to the realization of democracy and to democratic policy-making. Fifth, I will examine and critically assess Lindblom’s arguments for how the market promulgates ‘imprisoned thought.’ </p>
        <p>Lindblom’s general thesis affirms that the market is the most effective set of automatic punishments which work to resist social change. For example, when effective regulative legislation or banking reforms are proposed the business community is in automatic opposition, enforcing crippling punishments unless induced otherwise. In this way the market acts as a prison for social change; any change or reform business people oppose leads to unemployment or economic decline. Lindblom defines ‘full democracy’ as one in which policy-making is free from the prison of market society and which overcomes some ambiguous complications that might arise with the elimination of the markets. According to his thesis no market society can ever achieve full democracy (Lindblom 281).</p>
        <h4>The Mechanism</h4>
        <p>Lindblom describes the possibility of a change-repressing system which operates on a mechanism of “automatic punishment,” in the sense that the punishment follows from the very act intended to change the system. Such a mechanism is unique  because it doesn’t require deliberation or reservation to utilize, it is simply an automatic response to disincentives (Lindblom 275-6). He recognizes that this mechanism is already employed across certain aspects of political/economic life such as those institutions and policies that protect the decision-making authority of businessmen in their own prospects, maintain the status quo, and manage the labor movement. This cluster of institutions and organizations is known as the market or the business community. When the market is dissatisfied with some policy or reform the mechanism is triggered, delivering automatic punishments in the form of unemployment or a lethargic economy (Lindblom 276-9).</p>
        <p>The mechanism Lindblom describes affects two areas of influence; economics and thus policy-making and intellectual change. The first area of influence is more palpable since it affects our policy-makers and thus takes place largely within the public’s eye. For example, when representatives propose corporations accept a larger tax burden a prospect which triggers punishment from CEO’s who wish to avoid decreased profitability. Businessmen may argue publicly or convince senators that such a proposition would discourage business and force lay-offs (Lindblom 278-81).</p> 
        <p>The mechanism affects intellectual change when, for example, research into the possibility of fundamental change in business, such as worker participation in management triggers punishment from the academic community. This punishment occurs in the form of repressing thinking about politics and economics making certain positions impossible to advance in the academic world (Lindblom 276-83).</p>

         <h3>'The Dismal Science'</h3> <a href="../writing/gaus.pdf"><h4>click here to view full</h4></a>
        <p>Malthus’s observation that human populations could easily increase at a geometric rate—given enough resources, while increases in food production progress at an more constant rate, led to an assortment of economic and social implications; some pessimistic and some optimistic. The argument weighed heavily on the more egalitarian theories regarding wages and rent, and Malthus became a formidable critic (as well as correspondent) of the Ricardians, among which was James Mill, the father of John Stuart Mill. Decades later Mill Jr. endeavored to finish the work of Ricardo while considering the scientific findings of Malthus. At the same time Malthus’s doctrine had an influence on the development of Darwin’s theory of evolution.  The combined influence of Malthus’s social predictions and the apparent ‘solution’ Darwin’s theory offered for potentially unlimited (human) population growth led to Sumner’s social Darwinist approach to sociological progress.  The purpose of this essay is twofold; first, to identify where Mill and Sumner’s theories differ regarding what best serves human welfare into the future.  Secondly, to determine how the influences of Malthus, Ricardo and Darwin impacted Mill and Sumners’ beliefs about how the Malthusian dilemma was to be solved.</p>
        <p><i>Sumner and Mill focused the development of their theories in two separate directions, despite their shared Malthusian roots, for two distinct reasons. First, because of the extra importance Mill put on Ricardo’s influence and the role that both competition and customs played in his account of human welfare. Second, because of Sumner’s particularly rational and practical view of the ‘science of society’ and the profound influence Darwin had on him and the American culture where he developed his theories. 
        Although they shared a desire to contribute to human betterment, they disagree about how this may be accomplished. Mill struggles to satisfy the theories of both Malthus and Ricardo, while Sumner views a unique version of social Darwinism as the logical theory of how to apply Malthusian doctrine to a sociological progression.</i></p> 
        <h4>The Malthusian dilemma</h4>
        <p>If the unchecked human growth rate is geometric—the rate itself increases over time, then it follows from Malthus’s first postulate that food must exist in enough quantity to keep the added population living and to continue its growth. However, the increase in food produce follows and arithmetic rate of growth—the rate is continuous over time where the number e represents the constant proportionality between the growth rates. Therefore, humans will find subsistence to become increasingly difficult as more of the population is competing for the same diminishing increases in land produce. The economic implications on profits and wages led political economists to hypothesize a future in which economic growth would approach it’s limit worldwide; meaning the deferment granted by technological innovation and foreign investment will no longer be viable (Malthus 8-11).</p>
        <p>In Malthus’s famous ‘Essay’ he analyses the demographic and sociological evidence of the time but also describes the likely social consequences of his observations.  These consequences included misery and vice, and later moral restraint. Misery is caused by the positive checks on population growth which amounts to the increased mortality rate of the poor due to disease, starvation and war. Vice is caused by the preventative checks on population, due to the practical yet undesirable decision to put off raising a family owing to financial reasons. This outlook on checks to growth is consistent with that of Sumner (Malthus 9-13).</p>
        <h4>The ‘Dismal Science’</h4>
        <p>Both Mill and Sumner were driven to alleviate the necessary consequences of the Malthusian dilemma, but while Sumner stuck to operating within the Malthusian “dismal science,” Mill sought to develop an account that would undercut that foundation. Under classical political economy, and under the twin principles of Malthus’s theory of population and Ricardo’s decreasing productivity of land, Mill does not think that there are endless possibilities for growth. Ricardo and Mill both thought the end of growth was coming, and the wages of the working class would be driven down, because population growth would exceed the growth of capital. This led to Mill’s account of the inevitable ‘stationary state’ and his support of competition as a way to stem population growth, develop economically and socially, and prevent the population from losing mental facility. The stationary state represents a point that Malthusian law predicts must occur; when the population overtakes the subsistence needed to support it. It is in this theoretical future state that both Mill and Sumner make claims that stand in stark contrast to one another (Notes on Malthus, Ricardo, Mill and Sumner).</p>

          <h3>'The Best Way To Be Happy is to Satisfy Expectations'</h3> <a href="../writing/Bicchieri.pdf"><h4>click here to view full</h4></a>

            <p>The ultimatum and dictator games, in the one shot form, narrows down the relevant stimuli in distributional behavior so that there is no selfish incentive to allocate equally such as in the repeated form (where future payoffs enter into calculation). The results of these games and variations thereof show that people change their behavior in response to tweaks in the framing and payoffs; painting a portrait of fairness compliance that is very flexible. Only a norm-based approach has the flexibility to consider the empirical data while being specific enough to avoid un-falsifiable predictions.</p>

            <p>Bicchieri’s normative model explains and predicts why an individual might allocate resources equally, deviate from equality, and change their behavior because of seemingly irrelevant changes in the framing or context of the situation. <u>The occurrence of distinct human distributional behaviors, such as playing fair, are best explained by a tendency to ‘follow scripts and obey fairness norms’ so that individuals’ coordinate their expectations and behaviors.</u>  When deciding how to allocate resources people will look to what is being done before conforming to an inclination; all that is required is a sense of what the environment is eliciting in terms of prescriptive or descriptive behavior.</p> 

            <p>If a rational individual enters an ambiguous situation they seek to coordinate their expectations and behaviors with that of others. A norm is activated when an agent observes cues that tell them that a certain behavior is expected. Shared norms are required in order to explain how in ambiguous situations, self-serving biases occur in tandem with changes in the responders sensitivity to fairness because the process relies on a concern about expectations of the other party.</p> 

            <p>Bicchieri’s normative explanation for the phenomena observed in the ultimatum game is the most plausible because it explains how fairness is accomplished without appealing to moral reasons or fairness preferences. Her approach produces testable predictions that go beyond explaining the phenomena, and in doing so add credence to the model.</p>

             <h4>A Reason to be cautious about assuming this ‘normative’ explanation</h4>
            <p>When humans had to hunt as a group we relied on the groups’ strength to ensure successful future hunts. At this point individual survival depended on group survival and our selfish incentives were balanced with social incentives, which meant equal shares of meat for everyone was most efficient. We have had a partiality to egalitarian division since hunter-gatherer times which has evolved into a social moral tendency toward fairness that we balance with the tendency toward selfishness. <u>We play ultimatum games fairly because deep down we ‘know’ fairness is right and we attempt to do what is fair within the limits of egoism.</u></p>

            <p>Because we are rational, ‘wealth maxi-mizers’ as well as moral beings we must struggle to do the ‘right thing’, versus the left thing. A human being must decide but not based out of-------- The ultimatum game results show that we struggle to choose what is truly fair and sometimes bend the rules of fairness in our favor when we can. We engage in moral reasoning in order to decide if the situation calls for fairness or selfishness. The appearance of a self-serving bias is an example of selfishness beating out fairness as a personal rule of conduct for ambiguous situations. This is an internal struggle that is a function of survival, we rely on our ability to decide what is fair and unfair.</p> 
            <h4>The Economist Objection</h4>
            <p>The results of the ultimatum game can be explained through adaptation of traditional rational choice models. In these models people are concerned with the final distribution of a given allocation and prefer more to less; that is, they are rational wealth maximizers. However their utility functions are not narrowly selfish, individuals also have preferences over other people’s outcomes—an agent’s utility function includes others’ utilities so that as the utility of others increases so does his. <u>Fairness is therefore, a social preference, and the reason people play the ultimatum game fairly is because they have a preference for fair outcomes or aversion to unequal outcomes that factors into their decision making.</u></p>

            <p>People are basically self-interested, rational agents who always attempt to get the largest payoff possible but are also cognizant of other outcomes. When a person appears to be acting irrationally in the ultimatum game by playing fair, their behavior can be explained in terms of self-interest. The actions of a proposer, for example, can be determined by their preference over beneficial inequality and their belief about what the responder might prefer regarding negative inequality.  When preferences are applied to complex utility functions this model can also explain the variety of outcomes observed due to heterogeneous types of individuals. Some people may not be concerned with inequality which leaves them in a better place, and very concerned when inequality is disadvantageous to them. This is due to a rational process of calculation</p>
